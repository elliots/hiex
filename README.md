TODO:

Some plugins that will help :

http://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.draw/
Editing. Lets us draw the polygons on for the rooms.

http://kartena.github.io/Leaflet.Pancontrol/
http://kartena.github.io/Leaflet.zoomslider/
Pan and zoom controls.

http://dwilhelm89.github.io/LeafletSlider/
TIme slider. Not quite right but will help get started

https://github.com/jieter/Leaflet-semicircle
Useful if we want to indicate/animate the actual sensor locations

http://humangeo.github.io/leaflet-dvf/
A whole bunch of options here. Mini-graphs/indicators on the map?

Anyway. This example is pretty close too... showing geojson encoded polygons with mouseover.

After that its georeferencing/tiling the images using gdal+tilemill as described at
http://macwright.org/2012/08/13/images-as-maps.html

Integrating it into a template from wrapbootstrap

Writing the queries to pull back the data.
